🎯 Lightweight and easy to use, with a focus on simplicity

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Kotlin

UI Framework: Jetpack Compose

Architecture: Simple MVVM (if implemented) or direct state management

Tooling: Android Studio, Kotlin compiler, Compose preview

This app is ideal for those learning Jetpack Compose and looking for a practical example of managing user input, state, and UI rendering in a modern Android app. It uses Composable functions to build reusable UI components and demonstrates how to manage UI state effectively without relying on legacy XML layouts.

The project is beginner-friendly and can be extended with features such as persistent storage (Room/Datastore), dark mode, item categories, or cloud sync (Firebase). It also serves as a great foundation for exploring more advanced Compose concepts like LazyColumn, state hoisting, and side-effect APIs.
